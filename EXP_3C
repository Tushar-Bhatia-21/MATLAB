EXPERIMENT - 3(C)

Aim:
Generating a Random Sequence using rand()/randn() functions and plotting them.
Software used:
 MATLAB R2022b
Procedure:
X=rand(4)
Y=randn(3)

subplot(1,2,1)
plot(X)
title('Plot of X')
xlabel('X-axis')
ylabel('Y-axis')

subplot(1,2,2)
plot(Y)
title('Plot of Y')
xlabel('X-axis')
ylabel('Y-axis')

Discussion: 
Generating Random Sequence: 
R=randn(n) returns an n-by-n matrix containing pseudorandom values drawn from the standard normal distribution while r=rand(n) returns an n-by-n matrix containing pseudorandom values drawn from the standard uniform distribution on the open interval (0,1). 
Plotting using plot(): 
Plot(Y) plots the columns of Y versus the index of each value when Y is a real number and plot (X1, Y1,â€¦,Xn,Yn)plots each vector Yn versus vector Xn on the same axes. Functions xlabel and ylabel were used to label x and y axis. 
Plotting using stem(): 
It plots discrete sequence data. Stem(X,Y) plots X versus the columns of Y. X and Y must be vectors or matrices of the same size. 
Subplot():
Subplot divides the current figure into rectangular panes that are numbered rowwise. H=subplot(m,n,p) or subplot(mnp) breaks the figure window into an m-by-n matrix of small axes, selects the pth axes object for the current plot, and returns the axes handle. 
Result:
Random sequence was generated using rand () and randn(). And plotting was done using plot, subplot and stem functions.
 Conclusion:
Functions rand, randn, plot, subplot and stem were successfully performed.
