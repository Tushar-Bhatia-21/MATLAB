EXPERIMENT - 1(C)

Aim:
Performing Matrix Operations - Inverse, Transpose, Rank.
Software used:
 MATLAB R2022b

Procedure:
% Arrays Used: 

A=[50 20 30;10 90 40;100 80 70]

% Inverse
B=inv(A)

% Transpose
C=transpose(A)

% Rank
D=rank(A)

Discussion:

Inverse Operation:
Y=inv(X) returns the inverse of the square matrix X.
Transpose Operation:
B=transpose(A) returns the transpose of the matrix.
Rank Operation:
k=rank(A)
Result:
Two-Dimensional Matrix is created and Matrix operations: Inverse, Transpose and Rank were perfromed on it.

Conclusion:
Various Matrix Operations were successfully operated and results were obtained.
