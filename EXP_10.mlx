EXPERIMENT - 10

Aim:
Basic 2D and 3D plots: parametric space curve, polygon with vertices. 3D contour Lines. Pie and Bar Graph plots.
Software used:
 MATLAB R2022b
Procedure:
X=[10,15,25,40]
bar(X)
bar3(X)
pie(X)
pie3(X)

% Contour and Polygons
x=[0 0 0;1 1 -1;1 -1 -1]
y=[0 0 0;5 5 5;6 6 6]
z=[0 0 0;1 1 -1;1 1 1]
v=rand(3)
fill(x,y,z)
fill3(x,y,z,v)
grid on
contour(x)
contour(x,y,z)
Discussion:
contour(Z) creates a contour plot containing the isolines of matrix Z, where Z contains height values on the x-y plane. MATLABÂ® automatically selects the contour lines to display. The column and row indices of Z are the x and y coordinates in the plane, respectively. The polygon is plotted using the same principles. "pie3(X)" draws a three-dimensional pie chart using the data in X. Each slice of the pie chart represents an element in X.
Conclusion
Graph of polygon, pie, bar along with contour lines were plotted.
